-- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
While starting my career there was a senior person who named X and he was technically so strong and answer all the domain questions. "In five years, I aspire to become a highly skilled and reliable technical expert, much like a senior colleague I admired earlier in my career. He was not only technically proficient and well-versed in domain knowledge but also had the ability to simplify complex concepts for both technical and non-technical team members. His approachable nature, detailed documentation, and insightful code reviews significantly contributed to the team's learning and growth. My goal is to build a similar reputation within my organizationâ€”being the go-to person for technical and domain-related challenges, mentoring others effectively, and continuously advancing my knowledge to drive impactful contributions."
